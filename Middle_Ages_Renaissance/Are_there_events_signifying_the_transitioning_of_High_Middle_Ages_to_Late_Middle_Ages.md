## Are there events signifying the transitioning of High Middle Ages to Late Middle Ages? 

Yes, there are several key events and trends that are often associated with the transition from the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages:

1. **The Great Famine (1315-1317)**: Before the infamous Black Death, Europe faced a massive famine in the early 14th century. This catastrophe resulted from a series of poor harvests, leading to widespread food shortages, skyrocketing food prices, malnutrition, disease, and death. This crisis weakened the European population and made them more susceptible to future disasters, like the plague.

2. **The Beginning of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453)**: This prolonged conflict between England and France had deep roots in dynastic claims and territorial disputes. The war saw several shifts in momentum between the two powers and brought significant social, economic, and political changes to both countries.

3. **The Black Death (1347-1351)**: One of the most devastating pandemics in human history, the Black Death (a form of bubonic plague) killed an estimated 25-30% of Europe's population, and in some areas, the death rate was even higher. This profound demographic shift had lasting effects on European society, economics, and culture. 

4. **The Papal Schism (1378-1417)**: Also known as the Western Schism or the Great Schism, this was a split within the Roman Catholic Church where multiple popes claimed the papacy simultaneously. This divide deeply impacted the religious, political, and social fabric of Europe and eroded the prestige of the papacy.

5. **Rise of Vernacular Literature**: While Latin remained the primary language of scholarship, the Late Middle Ages saw a significant rise in literature written in the vernacular. Works like Dante Alighieri's "Divine Comedy" (written in Tuscan) and Geoffrey Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" (written in Middle English) are prime examples.

6. **Economic Changes**: The Late Middle Ages saw significant shifts in the European economy, including the decline of the manorial system and a crisis in the feudal order. Urbanization continued to rise, leading to an increase in trade and the growth of a merchant class.

7. **Cultural and Intellectual Shifts**: This period also witnessed the decline of scholasticism, a method of critical thought which dominated the High Middle Ages, and the rise of new intellectual movements. 

8. **Social Revolts**: The post-plague world saw a series of peasant revolts across Europe. A notable example is the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381, spurred by socio-economic tensions in the aftermath of the Black Death.

These events, among others, signify a period of significant change and turbulence as Europe transitioned from the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages.
