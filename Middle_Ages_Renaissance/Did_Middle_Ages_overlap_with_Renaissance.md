## Did Middle Ages overlap with Renaissance?

Yes, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance did overlap to some extent, but how one defines the beginning of the Renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages can affect the perceived overlap. 

1. **Middle Ages**: This period began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century and is typically said to end around the late 15th century. However, the exact endpoint can be debated. It's often divided into three sub-periods: 
   - **Early Middle Ages** (ca. 500-1000): Also known as the Dark Ages, especially in its earliest parts following the fall of Rome.
   - **High Middle Ages** (ca. 1000-1300): A time of significant growth, the rise of the medieval university, Gothic architecture, and the height of chivalry.
   - **Late Middle Ages** (ca. 1300-1500): Marked by events like the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War, and the rise of vernacular literature (like Dante's "Divine Comedy").

2. **Renaissance**: This cultural, artistic, political, and economic rebirth of interest in classical art and thought generally started in Italy in the late 14th century and lasted until the 17th century. The word "Renaissance" means "rebirth." It's characterized by major developments in art, with figures like Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo; in science with Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler; and in literature with figures like Petrarch, Erasmus, and Rabelais. 

The overlap, then, would be in the transition from the Late Middle Ages to the Renaissance, particularly in the 14th and 15th centuries. This transitional period is sometimes referred to as the "Proto-Renaissance," especially when discussing art in Italy.
